# CNN - Handwritten number recognition
 
This is my Convolutional Neural Netrowk for numbers recognition. Program is based on MNIST handwritten digit database.
I wrote program completely myself, mainly using NumPy library and without using any Machine Learning tools or libraries (tensorflow used once, only for easy importing of MNIST dataset). I used CNN implemented with keras as an exapmle and tried to implement every keras layer by myself. 
This program was written as an extra project for Machine Learing Course in National Taipei University of Techology (Taipei Tech).
At the time of creating this repository the program is in a state it was submitted to the proffesor as final program. However the program is not very good yet. At very first it is working very slow, one epoch takes many hours on my laptop, so I can't even test if whole program is working properly. Also bacpropagation to convolutional layer is not yet implemented.
